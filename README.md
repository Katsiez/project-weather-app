# Weather App

For this project, I have created a weather app showoing both the current weather, as well as the 5-day-forecast of my hometown - Toronto, Canada. This project features a simple and clean design that is optimized for most devices.

## The problem

Given that Toronto is located in a completely different timezone, I had to solve the problem of displaying data in the given timezone. I purposely chose Toronto as I viewed it as a challenge, and was pretty happy once I was able to display both the time, as well as the sunrise and sunset in Toronto timeformat!

For this project, I tried to implement some of the red-level features such as displaying the api server icons for the next five days.
I have as well implemented the background change feature which changes the background of the app once the temperature drops below 10 degrees.

Overall, I feel quite pleased with this project and if I had more time, I would most def. include more cities but for now, another timezone and a city other than Stockholm will have to suffice. :)
